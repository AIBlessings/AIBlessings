# 👋 Welcome to AIBlessings

Hi, I’m Tamara — a "HUMANS-1st" leader, tech-forward learner, and faith-driven strategist using AI for good.

After years in executive leadership, operations, and transformation consulting, I’ve pivoted into the AI and data space to stay ahead of where innovation is headed—while staying grounded in what matters most: people.

🌱 I’m currently pivoting into the AI & data space with a strong foundation in leadership, systems, and transformation.  
💻 I’m earning certifications in Generative AI for Business, Google Data Analytics, and Salesforce AI.  
🧠 I believe AI is a blessing when it's grounded in ethics, empathy, and everyday impact.  
📊 I’m building a portfolio that combines analytics, automation, and emotional intelligence.  
✨ My mission is the same in every space I enter: to elevate human potential, empower thoughtful leadership, and use innovation to help people thrive.  
🙏 “AIBlessings” is more than a name—it’s a commitment to building a future where intelligence is used with wisdom, and technology serves humanity.
